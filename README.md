# Audio Book TTS (Python + PyQt)

A simple desktop application that converts text into speech, built with **Python** and **PyQt**.  
This project was created as a learning exercise when I was starting out with GUI development in Python.

## 📖 Features
- User-friendly **PyQt-based** graphical interface
- Load text from a file or paste it directly
- Convert text into speech using Python's text-to-speech libraries
- Play, pause, and stop audio
- Adjustable voice speed and volume (if supported by the TTS engine)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **PyQt5** — for GUI
- **pyttsx3** (or similar TTS library) — for text-to-speech conversion

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadSohaib-240/Audio-Book-TTS-Python-PyQt.git
